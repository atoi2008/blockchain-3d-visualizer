# Blockchain 3D Visualizer

A C++ project that integrates **CPU mining** using the **RandomX** algorithm with **Vulkan** for real-time 3D visualization of the mining process. This project aims to create a procedural 3D environment that dynamically visualizes data from mining activities without relying on GPU-based computations for the mining algorithm.

Features
CPU Mining: Utilizes the RandomX algorithm for mining, executed on the CPU for efficiency and accessibility.
Vulkan Visualization: Renders real-time 3D environments reflecting mining data.
Cross-Platform: Designed to run on multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) with appropriate CPU support.
Procedural Graphics: Visualizes data such as hash rate, nonce attempts, and block progress using dynamic 3D models and particle effects.
Dependencies
Vulkan SDK (Required for 3D rendering)
GLFW (For windowing and input handling)
GLM (For 3D math operations)
Getting Started
Prerequisites
CMake: Install CMake for building the project.

Install CMake from https://cmake.org/download/
Vulkan SDK: Install Vulkan SDK from Vulkan SDK Website.

GLFW: Install GLFW for window creation and input handling.

On Linux (via apt): sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
On macOS (via Homebrew): brew install glfw
GLM: A header-only math library.

Install it using a package manager like vcpkg or manually download from here.
