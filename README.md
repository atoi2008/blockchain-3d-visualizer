# blockchain-3d-visualizer
A C++ project that integrates **CPU mining** using the **RandomX** algorithm with **Vulkan** for real-time 3D visualization of the mining process. This project aims to create a procedural 3D environment that dynamically visualizes data from mining activities without relying on GPU-based computations for the mining algorithm.
